# Tech Aloud Podcast

I have a new podcast called [Tech Aloud](https://anchor.fm/tech-aloud).

You can listen to it [directly on the Anchor FM site](https://anchor.fm/tech-aloud/) (thanks Anchor for hosting!) or via your favourite podcast listening system. If you don't have one, I'd highly recommend [Player FM](https://player.fm) - it's the one I use to subscribe and listen. For those wanting to get a link directly to the podcast's RSS feed so you can add it to the list of subscriptions in your own podcast player, the RSS feed is <https://anchor.fm/s/e5dc36c/podcast/rss>.

Here's a basic description of the podcast, which I expand upon in [Episode 1](https://anchor.fm/tech-aloud/episodes/Welcome-to-Tech-Aloud-e5ddsh): "_This podcast is tech articles & blog posts, read out loud, basically. A podcast I've wanted myself, so, while on the go, I can listen to articles that I might otherwise struggle to find time to read. That's about it, really! Thanks for listening._"

Note that the articles and blog posts I read out are, by definition, of a style that can be easily read out and understood in an audio-only context. So that means that I'll be avoiding articles and posts that involve and rely upon the display of program code or complex diagrams & pictures. 

Note also that my reading out loud of any given article or blog post does not represent any sort of endorsement from me - it's just that I find it interesting.

This GitHub repo is for me to [manage the tasks related to running this podcast](https://github.com/qmacro/tech-aloud/projects/1); let's see how it goes.
